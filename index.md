A scene from the Tidecaller mythology is randomly generated by an algorithm. The story is printed, compiled into a book, and the images are woven into knitworks. The story, once told in words, gains power through a medium, which has a physical form and texture. But it's a fictional, fake myth written by an AI that lacks cultural context and meaning.
